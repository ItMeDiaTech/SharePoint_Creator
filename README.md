```json
{
  "appName": "Tool Management Hub",
  "description": "Centralized hub for tool management and issue tracking",
  "backgroundColor": "#FFFFFF",
  "primaryColor": "#0078D4",
  "responsive": true,
  "orientation": "Both"
}
```

### Key Variables

Set these variables in the `OnStart` of your app:

```powerFX
// SharePoint Site URL
Set(varSiteUrl, "https://[tenant].sharepoint.com/sites/[sitename]");

// Theme Colors
Set(varThemePrimary, RGBA(0, 120, 212, 1));
Set(varThemeSecondary, RGBA(43, 136, 216, 1));
Set(varNeutralPrimary, RGBA(50, 49, 48, 1));
Set(varWhite, RGBA(255, 255, 255, 1));

// Refresh interval (minutes)
Set(varRefreshInterval, 5);
```

### Data Collections

Initialize collections for better performance:

```powerFX
// Load data into collections
ClearCollect(colIssueTracker, IssueTracker);
ClearCollect(colToolReleases, ToolReleases);
ClearCollect(colWorkInstructions, WorkInstructions);
ClearCollect(colNewsAnnouncements, Filter(NewsAnnouncements, IsActive = true));

// Set last refresh time
Set(varLastRefresh, Now());
```

## üé® Customization

### Updating Colors

Modify the theme colors in the app's `OnStart`:

```powerFX
// Corporate Blue Theme
Set(varThemePrimary, RGBA(0, 120, 212, 1));

// Corporate Green Theme
Set(varThemePrimary, RGBA(16, 124, 16, 1));

// Corporate Red Theme

```

### Adding New Statistics

To add new metrics to the Current Status section:

1. **Update the statistics gallery items**
2. **Add calculation formulas**
3. **Test with real data**

Example for adding "Issues This Year":

```powerFX
{
    Number: CountRows(Filter(IssueTracker,
        ReportedDate >= DateAdd(Today(), -365, Days))),
    Label: "Issues this Year"
}
```

### Customizing Navigation

Update the key items data to point to your specific SharePoint URLs:

```powerFX
{
    Icon: "üìã",
    Title: "Submit Issue",
    Description: "Report a new issue for a tool",
    Action: "https://[tenant].sharepoint.com/Lists/IssueTracker/NewForm.aspx"
}
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Connection Errors
**Problem**: App shows "Data source error" or blank data
**Solution**:
1. Verify SharePoint site URLs
2. Check list permissions
3. Re-authenticate connections
4. Test in Power Apps Studio

#### Performance Issues
**Problem**: App loads slowly or times out
**Solution**:
1. Implement data collections
2. Add delegation warnings checks
3. Limit gallery item counts
4. Use filtered views

#### Permission Denied
**Problem**: Users can't access lists or documents
**Solution**:
1. Verify SharePoint permissions
2. Check Power Apps sharing settings
3. Ensure proper licensing
4. Review security groups

### Data Issues

#### Missing Data
**Problem**: Lists appear empty or incomplete
**Solution**:
1. Add sample data using `SampleData.json`
2. Verify list column names match app formulas
3. Check view filters and permissions

#### Incorrect Calculations
**Problem**: Statistics show wrong numbers
**Solution**:
1. Verify date calculations and time zones
2. Check filter formulas
3. Test with known data sets
4. Review delegation limitations

## üì± Mobile Considerations

### Responsive Design
The app automatically adjusts for different screen sizes:

- **Desktop (>1024px)**: Full multi-column layout
- **Tablet (768-1024px)**: Condensed 2-column layout
- **Mobile (<768px)**: Single column with larger touch targets

### Testing
Test the app on various devices:
1. Desktop browsers
2. Power Apps mobile app
3. Tablet browsers
4. Different screen orientations

## üîí Security & Permissions

### SharePoint Security
- **Lists**: Configure appropriate permissions for each list
- **Libraries**: Secure work instruction documents
- **Site**: Review site-level permissions

### Power Apps Security
- **App Sharing**: Share with appropriate users/groups
- **Connection Security**: Use service accounts if needed
- **Data Loss Prevention**: Review organizational policies

## üìà Performance Optimization

### Data Loading
```powerFX
// Load only recent data for better performance
ClearCollect(colRecentIssues,
    Sort(
        Filter(IssueTracker,
            ReportedDate >= DateAdd(Today(), -30, Days)
        ),
        ReportedDate,
        Descending
    )
);
```

### Caching Strategy
```powerFX
// Refresh data only when needed
If(DateDiff(varLastRefresh, Now(), Minutes) >= varRefreshInterval,
    Refresh(IssueTracker);
    Set(varLastRefresh, Now())
);
```
